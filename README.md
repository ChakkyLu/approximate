# approximate

### Introduction

The program provides a new method to generate approximate adders and multipliers.
The basic idea is to study the characteristics of small circuits which share similar architecture and structures with large circuits.


### multipliers

There are several benchmarks you can find, mul: Array Multipliers (generated by abc); bar: Booth Array Multipliers (bp-ar-cl); bwt: Booth Wallace Tree Multipliers (bp-wt-cl);


### approximate_circuit:

There are some approximate multipliers generated by this program with different bitwidth.
